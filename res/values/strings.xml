    <string name="about">Thanks to ksubedi and \'ReverseAttack\' that made this possible,
        and of course the whole XDA community :).\n\nReverseAttack\'s website: http://wiki.rvr.kr/android/bootmenu
        \n\n A special thanks to the CyanogenDefy team as well for providing and maintaining newer bootmenu binaries.
        \n\n This tool was coded by Pedro Veloso : pedro.n.veloso@gmail.com
         \nI, the author, take no responsibility at all, in respect to everything that might or not happen.\n\n</string>

    <string name="instructions">\n===HOW TO INSTALL ====\n\nPress the button to install the 2ndInit Recovery. Choose the apropriate bootmenu for you, (Stable if you want to Install CyanogenMOD or MIUI).
        \nThe bootmenu will be download and installed. After it succeeds the top led will be green.
        \n\n Then disable USB debugging on Phone settings, and then reboot. You\'ll boot into bootmenu already.
        \n\nYou must choose your default boot option, or else you\'ll always boot to bootmenu first.
        \n On each reboot when the led displays blue on startup press the key Volume Down to enter the BootMenu.
        \n\nYou can use and redistribute this
        tool freely, and I take no responsibility at all, in respect to everything that might happen :P. \n\n
        \n\n===HOW TO USE CUSTOM URL===
        \n\nYou must provide a tar.gz file with similar structure of the ones I use. You can even provide the
        same bootmenus in different URLs, that is, mirror hosting. In case of doubt fell free to contact me.
